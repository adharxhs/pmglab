Collaboration and Remote Repositories:
Fetch the latest changes from a remote repository and rebase your local branch
onto theupdated remote branch.
Solution:
To fetch the latest changes from a remote repository and rebase your local branch onto the
updated remote branch in Git, follow these steps:
1. Open your terminal or command prompt.
2. Make sure you are in the local branch that you want to rebase. You can switch to the
branch using the following command, replacing <branch-name> with your actual
branch name:
$ git checkout <branch-name>
3. Fetch the latest changes from the remote repository. This will update your local
repository with the changes from the remote without merging them into your local
branch:
$ git fetch origin
Here, origin is the default name for the remote repository. If you have multiple remotes, replace
origin with the name of the specific remote you want to fetch from.
4. Once you have fetched the latest changes, rebase your local branch onto the updated
remote branch:
$ git rebase origin/<branch-name>
Replace <branch-name> with the name of the remote branch you want to rebase onto. This
command will reapply your local commits on top of the latest changes from the remote branch,
effectively incorporating the remote changes into your branch history.
5. Resolve any conflicts that may arise during the rebase process. Git will stop and notify
you if there are conflicts that need to be resolved. Use a text editor to edit the conflicting
files, save the changes, and then continue the rebase with:
$ git rebase --continue
