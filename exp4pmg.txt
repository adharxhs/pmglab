Experiment 4.
Collaboration and Remote Repositories:
Clone a remote Git repository to your local machine.
Solution:
To clone a remote Git repository to your local machine, follow these steps:
1. Open your terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the directory where you want to clone the remote Git repository. You can
use the cd command to change your working directory.
3. Use the git clone command to clone the remote repository. Replace <repository_url>
with the URL of the remote Git repository you want to clone. For example, if you were
cloning a repository from GitHub, the URL might look like this:
$ git clone <repository_url>
Here's a full example:
$ git clone https://github.com/username/repo-name.git
Replace https://github.com/username/repo-name.git with the actual URL of the repository you
want to clone.
4. Git will clone the repository to your local machine. Once the process is complete, you
will have a local copy of the remote repository in your chosen directory.
You can now work with the cloned repository on your local machine, make changes, and push
those changes back to the remote repository as needed.
